# Thomas Williams Personal Portfolio (Work in Progress)
I would first like to address the immediate concern of what the heck is an art portfolio doing on GitHub. For those that might not know this site it mainly used for hosting programming projects, which I have a few of on here actually and will be adding a few more. Now why does it make sense for me to have my image based portfolio here? A few reasons actually. The first one is that I already know how to use all the functionality needed to host these files here with descriptions of the projects. Once I have finished my personal website I can use links to these images and files for display and download on said site. Finally, it's free. So without further ado in mostly chronological order from most recent back here are various projects both art and otherwise I have worked on.
